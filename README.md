Generatify <br /> Strong and Secure Passwords Generator for Online Accounts
</h1>

Generatify is an open source [Angular 14]() SPA (_Single Page Application_) written in [Typescript](https://) and built with [TailwindCSS]().

The **main purpose** of the application is to **generate strong and secure passwords** by randomly combining letters, numbers and characters.

In this way, the application **prevents patterns** that can make the password an easy target **for brute force attacks**.
